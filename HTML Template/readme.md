## Sass

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that extends the functionality of regular CSS. It allows you to write more efficient, maintainable, and flexible styles by using features like variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions.

In simple terms, Sass makes it easier and faster to write CSS by giving you tools to organize and simplify your styles. Once you're done writing in Sass, you compile it into regular CSS that browsers can understand.

When we say that Sass is a CSS preprocessor, it means that Sass is a tool that processes your styles before they are turned into standard CSS that the browser can understand.

You write your styles in Sass using its special syntax and features (like variables, nesting, and mixins), and then the Sass preprocessor converts or "compiles" this into plain CSS. The resulting CSS file is what gets loaded by the browser to style your web page.

In short, Sass adds extra functionality to CSS, and the preprocessor handles turning that enhanced code into regular CSS.

Mixins in Sass are a way to create reusable blocks of CSS code that you can include in other styles throughout your stylesheet. They allow you to write CSS rules once and then apply them wherever you need, helping to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

scss (sassy CSS) is the file extension for Sass files.
scss - A newer syntax introduced by Sass, which is more similar to standard CSS. It uses curly braces ({}) and semicolons (;), making it more familiar to those who know CSS.

## Bootstrap Classes
col-12 class represents a column that spans the entire width of the row it's inside. Bootstrap's grid system is based on a 12-column layout, so col-12 takes up all 12 columns, meaning it will be full-width within the row, regardless of the screen size.

## Include File: An include file is a standard practice in PHP to reuse code across multiple files. It is generally a complete, standalone file that can be included wherever needed. It may contain functions, classes, HTML code, or any logic that should be reused.

## Partial: The term "partial" is commonly used in the context of web templating frameworks (like Laravel or other MVC frameworks) to refer to a reusable snippet of code (like a header, footer, or a sidebar). In essence, a partial is also included using the include() function, but it is more specific to reusable UI components. It's a convention rather than a different functionality from include.

## In summary, the destructor in your script will be called automatically when the DBController object is no longer in use, typically at the end of the script or when the object is explicitly unset or goes out of scope. This ensures that any open database connections are properly closed, preventing potential memory leaks or database connection issues.

### Null Coalescing Operator Does
The null coalescing operator (??) checks if the value on its left-hand side is null. If it is not null, it returns that value. If it is null, it returns the value on its right-hand side. Essentially, it's a shorthand for a common isset() check.

## "M.R.P." typically stands for "Maximum Retail Price." It refers to the highest price that a product can be sold to customers, as set by the manufacturer or brand.

## Purpose: URLSearchParams is a constructor that creates an object for handling URL query parameters. It converts the JavaScript object passed to it into a query string format, which is suitable for sending form-like data in a POST request.

## Object Parameter: { itemid: this.dataset.id } creates an object where the key is "itemid", and the value is this.dataset.id.

## this.dataset.id refers to the data-id attribute of the clicked button, which contains the unique ID for the product.
## The URLSearchParams converts this object into a URL-encoded string like itemid=123 (assuming the data-id is 123).
## This string will be included in the body of the POST request and sent to the server.
